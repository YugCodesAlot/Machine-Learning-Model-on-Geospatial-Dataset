# Geospatial Clustering and Supplier Agent Platform

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on clustering geospatial data using different clustering algorithms, including:
K-Means
DBSCAN
Agglomerative Clustering
HDBSCAN

**DataSet preparation**
The original dataset consisted of latitudes and longitudes which were majorly found in the ocean. Which is practically nonsensical.
However, the dataset is augmented in a way that it is perfectly fitting for real world applicaions. Such as: Supply Chain & Logistics, Disaster Management, Real Estate Analysis, and many more.

**Features**
Geospatial Clustering: Compare different clustering algorithms for latitude-longitude data.

**Tech Stack**
Languages: Python,
Platform: Google Colab
Libraries: scikit-learn, hdbscan, folium, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, and more

**Evaluation Metrics**
Silhouette Score: Measures how well-separated clusters are.
